Gabe is a statistical computing researcher with interests in
reproducibility, discoverability, and related meta-computing topics,
and in improving and advancing the R computing language. He proposed
the ALTREP framework recently added to R's internals - representing
one of the largest conceptual changes in R's history to how vector
data is fundamentally modeled internally - and collaborated closely with R-core
members on the design and implementation of the framework. Previously,
Gabe was a Scientist at Genentech Research, where he performed novel
research on how to improve the reproducibility, comparability, and
ultimate usefulness of computational results in multi-analyst
industrial research settings. He is currently taking time to focus on
open source projects. Gabe received his PhD in Statistics from the
University of California at Davis.
