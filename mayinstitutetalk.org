* Intro
** Who I Am
Gabe Becker

Twitter: [[http://twitter.com/groundwalkergmb][@groundwalkergmb]], GitHub: [[http://github.com/gmbecker][gmbecker
]]

** What I do

1. Research reproducibility and related issues
2. Contribute^ to the R language itself

#+ATTR_HTML: :class small
^ I collaborate with, but am not a member of, the R-core development team.

** Who I Was
Formerly Scientist at Genentech Research

Some content in this talk was developed (by me) while at, and is

** What I'll Be Talking About
- /Theory/ - mental models
  - Reproducibility - what it does and doesn't give us
  - Generalizing Reproducibility
- /Practice/ - what *you* can do now to improve your work

* I *Wish* Reproducibility Didn't Matter
** So Many Things Would Already Be Solved
** Energy (Cold Fusion)

** But We're Stuck In The Real World
And none of those claims were true^

#+ATTR_HTML: :class small
^To the best of our current knowledge
# Segue: all that said...
* (Computational) Reproducibility Is Not The Point
** Knowledge Management
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 65% :width 65%

** Reproducibility
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 65% :width 65%
[[./reproducibility_end.png]]
** So To Recap
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- The world would be better if all results were reproducible
- I don't /really/ care if your results are reproducible
** Seem Like A Contradiction?
[[./strapyourselfdownsbsp.gif]]

* What Do We Really Want?
** Results Are No Use To Us If They're Not Useful
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
[[./noduh2.gif]]
** But How Does Reproducting a Result /Make/ It Useful?
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 65% :width 65%
[[./waitwhat.gif]]
** We Want
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
Results we can understand and feel confident /using/ (Gavish)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- Incorporating them into our overall understanding
- Extending or directly utilizing  them in our own work
- Talking about them at dinner parties

* Trust, Verification and Guarantees
** Ways We Can Trust Results
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
1. *Trust in Reporting* - result is /accurately reported/
2. *Trust in Implementation* - analysis code /successfully implements/ chosen methods
3. *Statistical Trust* - data and methods are (still) /appropriate/
4. *Scientific Trust* - result /convincingly supports claim(s)/ about underlying systems or truths

** Reproducibility As A Trust Scale

** What Does Strict Reproduction Prove?
It confirms^ the original analyst(s)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+ATTR_HTML: :class left 
1. Got the result they say they got
2. By applying the code they provided
3. To the input data they identified
4. In the environment specified

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
And ensures you have the artifact itself

#+ATTR_HTML: :class small 
^ technically it does not /confirm/ these in the deductive sense, rather /proves/ them in the "beyond a reasonable doubt" sense.
* A Brief Thought Experiment
** Imagine an /Independent, Trusted/ System Which 
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+ATTR_HTML: :class left 
- Accepts code and data, and environment
- Runs the code
- Saves and publishes results and associates them with code and env
- Deletes the data (if necessary)

** This Would Provide Guarantees
Very similar (at least) to those gained by manual, strict reproduction,

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
*without requiring us to actually recreate the result at an arbitrary later date.*
* Reproducibility Isn't Everything - A Case Study

* Generalized Reproducibility
** 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Reproducibility is great, but by itself it is */neither as necessary nor as sufficient/* as many seem to think.

-- Me (and, like, other smart people too probably)
#+END_QUOTE
** Topics In Generalized Reproducibility
- Comparability
- Currency
- Completeness
- Provenance

* Comparability
** Individual "Data Science" Workflow

** Bleeding Edge Methods
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- Called this for a reason
- Continue to be refined
- Likely won't stay state of the art
- May not even remain valid
** No Hard-And-Fast Rule, But Generally
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- Modern versions take precedence
  - skeptical of genes in the 864 but not the 359
- Modern methods take precedence^

#+ATTR_HTML: :class small fragment appear
^ By how much depends on why the old method fell out of favor
** Note
The Currency concern is very real in Bioinformatics, Deep Learning,
and other fast moving settings. Its not really a concern when using a "classical" method (GLMs, Random Forests, etc).

* Completeness
** Literate Statistical Practice
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[The resulting document] should describe results and lessons learned ... as well as a means to reproduce *all steps, even those not used in a concise
reconstruction*, which were taken in the analysis.

-- Rossini, Literate Statistical Practice (emphasis mine)
#+END_QUOTE
** Translation
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 65% :width 65%

* Provenance
** Provenance 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
the source or origin of an object; its history and pedigree; a record of the ultimate derivation
and passage of an item through its various owners

-- Oxford English Dictionary
#+END_QUOTE
** Knowing a Result's Provenance Can Help Us  
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- Gain insights into the reasoning used to create it,
- verify acceptable procedures and methods were used, and 
- know how to reproduce it.

#+ATTR_HTML: :class small

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In theory there is no difference between theory and practice; in
practice there is.

* A "Slightly Out-of-Order" Reproduction Process
** 0. No Way To Get/Recreate Code and Data?
[[./youlose.gif]]
** 1. Works With Modern SW Versions
[[./newsieskingofny.gif]]
** 2. Try To Recreate Original Environment
[[./guessnumber.gif]]
** 3. Worked In 'Original' Env, We're Good!
[[./yeahbutarewe.gif]]
** 4. But Modern Results Disagree?
[[./severalquestions.gif]]

** 5. What Now?
We can
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
1. Take the modern results and move forward using them
2. Apply other methods to look for corroboration
3. Throw up our hands and switch to a field that uses established classical methods

* Things *You* Can Do *Now*
# NOTE: potentially move these inline with the sections? not sure
** Script
   [[./everythingannie.gif]]
** Scripted Analyses
# [[./candytrail.gif]]

[[./chickencement.gif]]
# We can find, reason about, and sometimes even correct them.

** Manual Steps
   [[./worldneverknow.gif]]

** Which Would You Rather Be Tested On?
1. How the chicken crossed the road, or
2. How many licks it took

** Avoid Encoding Metadata /Solely/ In Filenames
- Version
  - =thesis_final_revised_final_v2.Rmd=
- Species/Gene/etc
  - =mydata_BRAF_mut_only.dat=
- Timestamp
  - =mydata_as_of_2018_03_03.dat=


** Version Control   
[[./justdoit.png]]

* Literate Analyses
** Use rmarkdown, knitr, or Sweave
This gets /trust in reporting/ taken care of^ right away, and its super easy.

#+ATTR_HTML: :class small
^absent actual misconduct, ie editing output files manually
** Want to Use Jupytr/Rmarkdown Notebooks?
You *must* go watch or read Joel
Grus' fantastic talk first

#+ATTR_HTML: :class small
Watch: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :class small
Read: [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/]]

** 3 Rules If You Still Want To Use Notebooks
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
1. Always run them start to finish before publication
2. *Never* fully trust output in a notebook that wasn't run start to finish
3. *Always. Run. Them. Start. To. Finish. Before. Publishing.*

* Sharing
** Current State
[[./thisisfinecrop.png]]
** Current State
Authors for only ~ 44% (36%, 50%) of papers in Science shared both code and data
[[./stoddenempir.png]]
** Share Your Code!
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- If it's right no one cares how ugly it is
- If it's wrong, readers deserve to know
  - And you do, too
** Share Your Data (If Ethically Allowable)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
When to share data is a tricky question.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
/*But* answers of "never" and "only once its obsolete/irrelevant" make you the villain of the piece./

** Publish Science
As if /*you, personally*/, will need to understand, evaluate, use, and extend your result in 5 years, /*working only from published materials*/, having lost all personal materials.

* Environment Recreation
** Environment Recreation
Crucial for both *multi-analyst collaboration* and for *strict reproduction*

Remember to think about currency 
** Recreating/Distributing R Package Libraries
- switchr
- packrat
- MRAN snapshots

* Docker For Reproducibility
** Its Easy
- Boettiger and Eddelbuettel, An Introduction to Rocker: Docker Containers for R, The R Journal, 2017
  - https://www.rocker-project.org/
- See Also: Bioconductor AMIs http://bioconductor.org/help/bioconductor-cloud-ami/
** Confession
[[./dontlikeit.jpeg]]

** mybinder.org
Check out [[http://mybinder.org]]

- Makes your code runnable by others
- Uses docker
- Careful of changing dep version in images across time

* Provenance-lite
** Aspire To

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- Know where your data came from
- Pass that information along with you results (and code)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
(Even if imperfectly)

* Publishing Results
** What To Include

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- Code (+ /detailed/ description of any manual steps)
- Data (if you can)
- Data Provenance (if you have it)
- Version/environment info
** Consider Open Access When You Can

Not a simple issue, but ask yourself /*how can a result be useful to people who can't even read about it?*/


* Wrap-up and Conclusions
** 
[[./whatthehelljusthappened.gif]]
** Think About What you Actually Want
And whether/how you can 
#+ATTR_HTML: :class left 
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
1. Get it
2. Provide it to your readers
** Reproducibility is NOT Valueless
But it is most usefully viewed within a larger, more nuanced context.
** Share Your Code and Data (If Possible)
And don't be assholes to others who do the same. Even when you find
problems in it.
** Publish Science
You'd be able to trust if it came out of a lab you don't know.
